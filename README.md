# Tarot_card_bot
This Tarot bot for Telegram is capable of providing predictions upon user request. 
- Type `/start` to begin the conversation.
- When a request includes the phrase `"карт* дня"` the bot will draw a prediction card for the day - one of the major arcana — in either an upright or reversed position. It will also explain the meaning and display the card’s image.
- Press the "Карта дня" button to get the card of the day. The function is similar to writing a request using the keyboard.
- Press the "Поприветствовать еще раз" button to get a new greeting.
- The "Отправить фидбек" button will offer to write feedback on the bot's work.
- The "Какие обновления запланированы? button will tell you about the nearest plans for updating the bot.
- Additional functionality will be added and improved in future versions.
